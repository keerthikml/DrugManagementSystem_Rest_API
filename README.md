# DrugManagementSystem_Rest_API
I have developed a robust Drug Management System Rest API with Drug and Supplier Controllers. The API enables CRUD operations for drugs, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. It allows seamless management of suppliers, with CRUD operations for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting supplier details.
